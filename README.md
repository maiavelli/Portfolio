# Maia's Portfolio
## Description

A portfolio of work samples that is meant to grow and be added to as I learn coding and create more projects and applications. 

- My motivation while building this project was to build a site that was simple enough to be adaptable and able to grow as my skills evolve, while also maintaining an appealing visual appearance that aligns with my personal style.
- I learned a LOT about flexbox while building this project and I feel much more confident with it now. The perfectionist in me definitely ran into some frustrations controlling certain elements and getting them to appear how I wanted but with some perserverance, I prevailed :) 

## Usage
